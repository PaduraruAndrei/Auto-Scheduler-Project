Starting from 17:30 I started with finding ideas of projects to put on my CV.
Now that I found the idea, I went with first trying to put stuff in my google calendar.
First I wanted to try and do the python implementation of google calendar
For this I went to https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python
First Step: I had to enable the API in the google cloud console
Second Step: 
I created a project and started configuring the google auth platform 
I chose external

I am using PostgreSQL for the database
I created a data folder, and started the database by inputting
'initdb data' in the console
Now onto creating the actual database

The databse will have 2 tables: 1 with email, which will be encrypted and user id.
The other one will have user id, as well as the events in one's calendar.

Ended up questioning myself how do I get the events from the google calendar,
so I ended up this tutorial:

I then realized that only the events from my email calendar were gotten, and not the ones from university
so I then got everh calendar from the service, and then got the first 10 events starting from the current time
from each calendar.
